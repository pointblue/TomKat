# TomKat State of the Ranch Data Pages

[Point Blue Conservation Science](http://www.pointblue.org) has
partnered with [TomKat Ranch](https://tomkatranch.org) to collect many
different types of data reflecting changing conditions on the ranch.
Every year, we summarize these data and provide Ranch staff with an
update. This project contains the data and code for producing these data
summaries as individual web pages.

### CURRENT STATUS:

All data are currently viewable at
[https://pointblue.github.io/TomKat](https://pointblue.github.io/TomKat/)
and on the [TomKat Ranch
website](https://tomkatranch.org/what-we-do/regenerative-ranching/management-data/#ranch-data-project)

Updates including data through 2021 are currently in progress.

### FUTURE WISHLIST

-   Throughout: Add more context linking SMART goals to observations to
    date
-   Soil: Add map showing soil fungal data
-   Vegetation: Add links to pasture plants guide and species lists
-   Water: Add info about steelhead, water quality data
-   Birds: Add links to wildlife/bird checklists; add photos; add info
    about banding and Christmas Bird Count surveys; Compare bird
    densities to management data (difficult with annual sampling effort)
-   Management: Add map of ranch trials, mowing history, grazing chart
