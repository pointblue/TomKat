Birds
===============================
####Since 2010, Point Blue Conservation Science has conducted <b>`r format(nsurveys, big.mark=',')` bird surveys</b> across TomKat Ranch during May and June and detected a total of <b>`r nspecies` bird species</b>. Each year, biologists conduct point count surveys for birds at a random sample of points chosen from a grid across the ranch, as well as at 12 points in riparian vegetation along Honsinger Creek. We analyzed this data to examine spatial patterns in [grassland bird abundance](#distribution) and [species richness](#richness) across the ranch, as well as ranch-wide [trends in grassland bird abundance](#trends) and [trends in species richness](#richtrend). {#intro}

### Average focal species abundance 

The density of grassland focal species (Grasshopper Sparrow and Savannah Sparrow) varies across the ranch. We compiled  bird survey data across 2010-`r max(dat$year)` to estimate the overall average density (birds per 10 acres) of each species at each survey point across the ranch.

### Focal species declines 
  
Since 2010, we have observed a slight ranch-wide decline in the density of Savannah Sparrows and Grasshopper Sparrows.

### Species richness concentrated along Honsinger Creek  
  
The shading in this map shows the estimated number of species ever detected near a bird survey station, with darker colors representing more species. Honsinger Creek is a hotspot of bird species richness, with some of the highest numbers of species, but there are also some other hotspots across the ranch.

### Decline in grassland species richness  
Ranch-wide, there were initially more total species in grassland point than in riparian points, but grassland species richness has declined in recent years while riparian richness has remained steady through the drought.
