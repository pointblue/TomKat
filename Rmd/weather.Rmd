TomKat Ranch: Weather
=========================
Point Blue Conservation Science established a weather station at TomKat Ranch in September 2010. Since 2013, we have observed [consistently warm and dry weather](#diff) and [extreme drought](#drought) conditions, although the drought has begun to relax in 2016. [Explore data](#table).

### Daily weather

Daily <font color="`r pointblue.palette[3]`"><b>high temperature</b></font>, <font color="`r pointblue.palette[2]`"><b>low temperature</b></font>, and <font color="`r pointblue.palette[1]`"><b>precipitation</b></font> from the TomKat weather station, along with the <font color="`r pointblue.palette[7]`"><b>range of temperatures and precipitation</b></font> observed on each date since the weather station was established. <i>Note: No weather data were recorded between March and August 2016 when the weather station was being updated.</i>

The highest temperature yet recorded was <b>`r dat %>% filter(var == 'high') %>%select(value)`&deg;F</b> on `r dat %>% filter(var == 'high') %>% select(date)`. The lowest was <b>`r dat %>% filter(var == 'low') %>%select(value)`&deg;F</b> on `r dat %>% filter(var == 'low') %>%select(date)`. The single rainiest day was `r dat %>% filter(var == 'rain') %>%select(date)`, with a total of <b>`r dat %>% filter(var == 'rain') %>%select(value)` inches</b> recorded.

### Consistently warm and dry weather
TomKat has been warmer and dryer than historic averages in almost every month since the spring of 2013, including during the <b>growing season</b> (March-June, shaded). Values greater than zero are above the historic average (1980-2010), and values below zero are below average.

### Nearly 4 years of drought come to an end
Central Coastal California entered drought conditions early in 2013, which persisted until the fall of 2016 with the onset of a record-setting wet winter. However, conditions are drying again with the slow start to the rainy season in 2017-2018.

#### Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)
The PDSI is an indicator of long-term drought that takes into account precipitation and temperatures over several months. Values less than -2 are considered to be <b><font color='`r oranges[3]`'>moderate</font></b> (-2 to -3), <b><font color='`r oranges[4]`'>severe</font></b> (-3 to -4), or <b><font color='`r oranges[5]`'>extreme drought</font></b> (-4 and below). Values greater than 2 are considered to be <b><font color='`r blues[3]`'>moderately</font></b> (2 to 3), <b><font color='`r blues[4]`'>very</font></b> (3 to 4), or <b><font color='`r blues[5]`'>extremely moist</font></b> (4 and above). 

The PDSI for Central Coastal California was at <b><font color='`r oranges[5]`'>extreme drought</font></b> levels from June 2013 through November 2015, except briefly during the very rainy December of 2014, and did not return to normal range until October 2016. Conditions in Northern Coastal California were never quite as dry as Central Coastal California, and recovered dramatically almost a year earlier than Central Coastal Caliafornia in December 2015. Southern Coastal California generally fared worse, and did not return to normal range until January 2016.

#### Palmer Z Index (PZI)
The PZI measures short-term drought on a monthly scale, and can better reflect recent soil moisture conditions. Values less than -1.25 are considered to be <b><font color='`r oranges[3]`'>moderate</font></b> (-1.25 to -2), <b><font color='`r oranges[4]`'>severe</font></b> (-2 to -2.75), or <b><font color='`r oranges[5]`'>extreme drought</font></b> (-2.75 and below). Values greater than 1 are considered to be <b><font color='`r blues[3]`'>moderately</font></b> (1 to 2.5), <b><font color='`r blues[4]`'>very</font></b> (2.5 to 3.5), or <b><font color='`r blues[5]`'>extremely moist</font></b> (3.5 and above). 

The impact of big storms can be more readily seen in this index, such as the <b><font color='`r blues[5]`'>extremely moist</font></b> December 2014, October 2016, and January 2017. Northern and Central Coastal California have had more frequent short-term relief from drought conditions through such storms than Southern Coastal California.
