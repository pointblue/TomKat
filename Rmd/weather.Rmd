Weather
=========================
####Point Blue Conservation Science established a weather station at TomKat Ranch in September 2010. Since 2013, we have observed [consistently warm and dry weather](#diff) and [extreme drought](#drought) conditions.{#intro}

<a id='daily'></a>  

### Daily weather

Daily <font color="`r pointblue.palette[3]`"><b>high temperature</b></font>, <font color="`r pointblue.palette[2]`"><b>low temperature</b></font>, and <font color="`r pointblue.palette[1]`"><b>precipitation</b></font> from the TomKat weather station, along with the <font color="`r pointblue.palette[7]`"><b>range of temperatures and precipitation</b></font> observed on each date since the weather station was established. <i>Note: Gaps in weather data occurred when the weather station was being upgraded.</i>

The highest temperature yet recorded was <b>`r dat %>% filter(var == 'high') %>%select(value)`&deg;F</b> on `r dat %>% filter(var == 'high') %>% select(date)`. The lowest was <b>`r dat %>% filter(var == 'low') %>%select(value)`&deg;F</b> on `r dat %>% filter(var == 'low') %>%select(date)`. The single rainiest day was `r dat %>% filter(var == 'rain') %>%select(date)`, with a total of <b>`r dat %>% filter(var == 'rain') %>%select(value)` inches</b> recorded.

### Consistently warm and dry weather  
TomKat has been warmer and dryer than historic averages in almost every month since the spring of 2013, including during the <b>growing season</b> (March-June, shaded). Values greater than zero are above the estimated historic average (1980-2010)*, and values below zero are below average.

<i>*Historic averages are estimated from comparing current TomKat and Half Moon Bay data, and applying corrections to historical averages from Half Moon Bay, 1981-2010.</i>

### Drought conditions return  

We examined two drought indices from the [National Centers for Environmental Information](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/drought/historical-palmers/overview): the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the Palmer Z Index. The PDSI is an indicator of long-term drought that takes into account precipitation and temperature over several months, while the Z index measures short-term drought on a monthly scale, and can better reflect recent storms and soil moisture conditions.

### Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)
The PDSI for Central Coastal California entered drought conditions early in 2013, which persisted nearly 4 years until October 2016, including over two years of <b><font color='`r palette[7]`'>extreme drought</font></b> from June 2013 through November 2015. Despite returning to normal range for most of 2017, <b><font color='`r palette[5]`'>moderate drought</font></b> conditions returned in 2018.

In comparison, conditions in Northern Coastal California were never quite as dry as Central Coastal California, and recovered almost a year earlier than Central Coastal California in December 2015. Southern Coastal California generally fared worse, and only briefly returned to normal range in January - March 2017.

### Palmer Z Index (PZI)

The PZI more readily shows the impact of big storms, such as the <b><font color='`r palette[1]`'>extremely moist</font></b> December 2014, October 2016, and January 2017. Northern and Central Coastal California had more frequent short-term relief from drought conditions through these storms than Southern Coastal California.
