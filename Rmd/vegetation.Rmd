TomKat Ranch: Vegetation
===============================
Point Blue Conservation Science has surveyed grassland vegetation across TomKat Ranch each summer since 2011. We examined patterns in the [current distribution of vegetation](#distribution) across the ranch, [pasture-specific changes](#diff) in vegetation since 2012, and [ranch-wide vegetation trends](#trends). [Explore data](#table).

<a id='distribution'></a>

### Current Vegetation Distribution 

In 2018, <b>perennial grasses</b> were more common on the west side of the ranch, while <b>invasive weeds</b> are more prevalent on the central and eastern parts of the ranch.

### Pasture-specific changes  
Pasture-specific changes in vegetation cover may reflect the interaction between weather, local soil conditions, and pasture-specific management decisions. Since 2012, <b>perennial</b> and <b>native grasses</b> have increased more on the west side of the ranch.

### Ranch-wide vegetation trends
  
Since 2012, <font color='`r pointblue.palette[1]`'><b>total grass cover</b></font> has remained fairly steady and is the dominant ground cover. We have not detected any strong trends in any vegetation type.

#### Grasses  

Ranch-wide, we have detected a significant increase in <font color='`r pointblue.palette[2]`'><b>native grasses</b></font>, and a trend toward increasing <font color='`r pointblue.palette[3]`'><b>perennial grasses</b></font>.

### Glossary

**Perennial grasses:** Grasses that can survive for many years, whereas annual grasses germinate from seed, reproduce, and die each year. Perennial grasses generally turn green sooner, stay green longer, produce more biomass, and are more drought-tolerant than annual grasses. Their deep roots stabilize soil, improve water infiltration, and recycle nutrients. 

**Native grasses:** California native grasses are perennials, which have been largely displaced by exotic annual grasses.

**Forbs:** Herbaceous flowering plants that are not grasses, sedges or rushes.
