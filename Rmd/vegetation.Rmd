Vegetation
===============================
####Point Blue Conservation Science has surveyed grassland vegetation across TomKat Ranch each summer since 2011. We examined patterns in the current vegetation cover and diversity in each pasture, changes over time in each pasture, and ranch-wide vegetation trends.{#intro}


### SMART Goals

<b>Increase perennial grass:</b> Average of 20% native perennial grass cover on the West side by 2020.

<b>Maintain covered soil surface:</b> All pastures average <5% bare ground across the ranch by 2020.


### Current vegetation cover

Vegetation cover varies across the ranch, likely reflecting the interaction between local soil conditions, management decisions, and weather. In 2018, native grasses were more common on the west side of the ranch, while invasive weeds were more prevalent on the central and eastern parts of the ranch.

### Vegetation changes over time  

Vegetation cover changes over time, and the amount of change has varied by pasture. Again, these changes likely reflect the influences of both weather (drought) and management decisions, and depend on local soil conditions. Comparing 2016-2018 to 2012-2014, perennial and native grass cover has more than doubled in several pastures.

### Ranch-wide vegetation trends
  
Since 2012, grass cover dropped slightly during the drought and rebounded in 2018. Bare ground has been declining since 2014, and in 2018, invasive weeds were at their lowest levels yet.

### Grasses  

Perennial grasses and native grasses are trending upward.

### Current vegetation diversity

The number of plant species in each pasture varies across the ranch. We summarized the average number of species detected in 2016-2018, excluding shrubs and trees.

### Glossary

**Perennial grasses:** Grasses that can survive for many years, whereas annual grasses germinate from seed, reproduce, and die each year. Perennial grasses generally turn green sooner, stay green longer, produce more biomass, and are more drought-tolerant than annual grasses. Their deep roots stabilize soil, improve water infiltration, and recycle nutrients. 

**Native grasses:** California native grasses are perennials, which have been largely displaced by exotic annual grasses.

**Forbs:** Herbaceous flowering plants that are not grasses, sedges or rushes.
