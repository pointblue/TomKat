TomKat Ranch: Soils
===============================
Point Blue Conservation Science tested soils at <font size=4><b>`r nsites` sites</b></font> across TomKat Ranch in 2018 to examine  [soil productivity indicators](#productivity), including [organic carbon content](#carbon), [soil bulk density](#density), and [water infiltration rates](#infiltration), as well as an [overall score](#overall). We also examined [changes in soil productivity indicators](#diff) since initial surveys in 2014,  [soil nutrient concentrations](#nutrients), and [soil microbes](#microbes). 


<a id="productivity"></a>

### Soil productivity indicators

Sites with relatively high overall scores may be the most productive while sites with relatively low overall scores may be good candidates for management actions designed to improve soil productivity.

*Note: These scores are only based on comparing these locations to each other and not to values that may be found elsewhere on the ranch or beyond. We measured carbon content at two soil depths, and in the map below, the inner circle represents the carbon concentration at the surface (0-10 cm deep), and the outer circle represents deeper soil (10-40 cm).

### Changes in soil productivity indicators

Improvements in each indicator are shown in blue, and declines are shown in orange. Note that lower values in bulk density and water infiltration reflect improvements.

### Soil nutrient concentrations
In 2015, we measured soil nutrient concentrations and pH at two soil depths. In the map below, the inner circle represents the surface soil sample (0-10 cm deep), and the outer circle represents the deeper soil sample (10-40 cm).

### Glossary

<a id="density"></a>  
<b>Bulk density:</b> An indicator of soil compaction, bulk density is measured as the weight of a soil sample divided by its volume (grams/cm^3^). Compacted soils have a higher bulk density, with reduced pore space for water infiltration, water retention, root growth, soil aeration, and seedling germination.

<a id="infiltration"></a>  
<b>Water infiltration rate:</b> Also an indicator of soil compaction, water infiltration rate is measured as the time required for soil to absorb water (minutes per inch of water). Compacted soils take longer to absorb water, increasing runoff and decreasing water available for local plant growth.

<a id="carbon"></a>  
<b>Organic carbon content:</b> An indicator of soil organic matter and soil productivity, organic carbon is measured as the percent of soil volume made up by organic carbon. Productive soils have an abundant microbial community that contribute to high levels of soil organic matter, driving plant growth and improving soil stabilization and capacity for storing water.

<a id="overall"></a>  
<b>Overall score:</b> To combine values of all 3 soil metrics above into one overall score, we first calculated a separate percentile score for each metric (including separate scores for surface and deeper soil carbon). These percentile scores represent how relatively good or poor each point scored for each metric compared to all the other TomKat soil sampling points, and they were based on fitting [empirical cumulative distribution functions](https://www.r-bloggers.com/exploratory-data-analysis-conceptual-foundations-of-empirical-cumulative-distribution-functions/) to each metric. We then calculated an overall percentile score as the mean of these individual percentile scores, so that points with a combination of high and low scores might fall in the "moderate" category.
